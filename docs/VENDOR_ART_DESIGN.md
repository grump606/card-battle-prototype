# Vendor scene

An animated, code-drawn stall behind the vendor panel (`run/vendor_scene.gd`, `class_name VendorScene`). No image assets. `run.gd` adds one as the first child of the body at a vendor stop (full rect, mouse ignored) and then the panel on top; every other screen is unchanged.

## Composition and palette

A ghostly vendor trades from a baggage car. A hooded shopkeeper (a dark cloak, a void face with a veil and two amber eyes) sits behind a counter, with shelves of old suitcases, hatboxes and jars on both sides and four lanterns hanging from a rail. The three offers stand on the counter, the speech banner sits across the shopkeeper's chest, and the services sit on the counter front.

Warm lantern amber `(1.0, 0.78, 0.42)` and brass `(0.78, 0.55, 0.24)` over wood browns `(0.22, 0.13, 0.075)` and a near-black wall `(0.085, 0.06, 0.05)`; cloak `(0.035, 0.03, 0.045)`, pale ghost `(0.72, 0.84, 0.95)` only on the veil and glass. No enemy red and none of the class colours.

## Layers (back to front) and motion

All motion derives from one accumulator `time`; every flicker is a pure function of it.

1. Wall planks and the lantern rail (static), the pool of lamp light behind the shopkeeper (flickers).
2. Shelves with luggage (layout from the fixed seed; lit by the nearest lantern).
3. Four lanterns on chains, each swinging on its own rhythm with a smooth halo and its own flicker.
4. Shopkeeper: breathing (2 px, 1.1 rad/s), a blink every 4.7 s, a rim of lantern light on the shoulders.
5. Counter: top with lamp pools, brass edge, front with plank seams.
6. Till (brass, display reads the gold, coin stacks of five up to 15 coins, glows 0.8 s after a change), a case with a swaying tag, a service bell.
7. A prop left of each service button: ticket-punch (Remove), medicine bottle (Heal, glows), small case (Leave); dimmed when the button is disabled.
8. 36 dust motes, then a scrim (darker sides and top; 60% dim over everything while the remove picker is open).

## Legibility budget

- The panel is real controls: CardViews (prices as labels under each, SOLD / NEED n GOLD on the card), Buttons with their original text, and two ribbon labels (greeting and last result) on a 90% dark, brass-edged background. The service buttons have a dark fill, brass border and a visible focus outline.
- Behind text the art stays dark and low-contrast: no lantern, shelf or prop sits behind a ribbon or label; the counter top behind the price labels is about 0.2 luminance. Small lanterns are above the banner.

## Layout at 1152x648

The body is about 1120x590 under the header line. The panel is one centred column: a 104 px head space (the hood), the banner (and result banner), the offers (card 163x235 at 1.2), prices, the service row. About 480 to 520 px in all. The stall tracks the panel by reference (`head_anchor`, `counter_anchor`, `service_anchors`, read each draw), so it follows layout changes; without them it uses defaults. In the picker the head space is dropped and the stall is dimmed.

## Variants

None. When the player cannot afford the cheapest offer (`Vendor.PRICE_CHEAP`) the greeting changes to a line about empty pockets; the till shows the lower gold and fewer coins.

## Performance and tests

About 400 `draw_*` calls a frame (rects, lines, small polygons, circles and three strings; no textures, no shaders), redrawn only from `advance()`, which does nothing unless the node is visible in the tree (`_process` is switched off while hidden; the paused tree stops it too). The generator is local with a fixed seed, so the run RNG is untouched.

`tests/ui_vendor_scene_test.gd` (in `scripts/check.ps1`) covers building, determinism, hidden/detached freeze, mouse ignore, the till, and a real vendor stop with one stall beneath clickable offers. `tools/vendor_sheet.gd` takes the screenshots (not headless).
