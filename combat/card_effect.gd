class_name CardEffect
extends Resource
## One atomic outcome of a card play or an enemy intent.
## EXPOSE (`amount` = turns): on a card it exposes its targets (the player for
## SELF cards); on an enemy intent it exposes the player for the next `amount`
## enemy phases.

## New kinds are only ever appended: .tres files store the kind as its integer value.
## HOLD: keep up to `amount` of your remaining Block into your next turn.
## DAMAGE_PER_BLOCK: damage equal to your current Block times `amount`.
## DAMAGE_IF_BLOCK: `bonus` damage if your Block is at least `threshold`, else `amount`.
## THORNS: until your next turn, each enemy attack on you also deals `amount` to that attacker.
## GAIN_ENERGY: gain `amount` energy now (it can lift energy above the per-turn amount).
## DAMAGE_PER_PLAY: `amount` plus `bonus` for each card played earlier this turn.
## HAUNT: the targets take `amount` damage at the start of each enemy phase, which then falls by 1
## each phase. Stacks add. Haunt damage ignores Block and Expose.
## LOSE_HP: the player pays `amount` HP, ignoring Block (a card with this cannot be played if it would
## kill the player: see CardData.hp_cost).
## HEAL_PER_HAUNTED: heal `amount` for each living enemy that is Haunted.
## DAMAGE_PER_HAUNT: damage equal to the target's Haunt times `amount`.
